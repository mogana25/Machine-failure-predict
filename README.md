# Machine Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
Machine Failure Prediction is a Machine Learning project that predicts whether a machine is likely to fail based on historical sensor and operational data.  
This helps in **preventive maintenance**, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.

---

##  Objective
To build a machine learning model that can:
- Analyze machine data
- Predict potential failures
- Help industries take action before breakdown occurs

---

##  Dataset
- Historical machine sensor data
- Includes features like temperature, pressure, vibration, and operational conditions
- Target variable indicates machine failure (Yes / No)

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)

---

##  Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  

---

##  Workflow
1. Data Loading  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Selection  
5. Model Training  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Performance Comparison
